Drive an iRobot Create (Roomba) Â© over the web

## Overview
Let's drive a Roomba via a web interface (shown here, running in Chrome on a laptop and a smartphone):

Using the webpage is simple. Just hold down any of the buttons to move or spin the roomba in that direction. You can also rotate the orientation of the webpage in order to match it to the current orientation of the roomba, using the top two buttons.

When you first open the webpage, the server has not yet tried to communicate with the roomba over the roomba's serial port. Plugging a USB-to-serialport adapter into the server will expose the roomba on either of two serial interfaces, so try clicking `/dev/ttyUSB0` first, and if that doesnt work (or if the USB cable accidentally gets disconnected from the Roomba while driving), try the other one. In case neither works, try navigating to `http://roomba:9876/debug` in your browser, and looking for `*USB0` or `*USB1` in the list (where `roomba` is the IP address of the server, e.g., `localhost` if you are SSH'd in) - if you don't see any `*USB*` entries, check the physical connections.

To dissuade your lab partner's natural inclination to try driving your laptop into traffic or down a stairwell, it is suggested to connect your laptop to the Roomba's serialport wirelessly, using [XBees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBee): as a result, the full chain of control is:

In additon to using the buttons on the webpage, you can drive the roomba around programatically:

```bash
$ curl http://roomba:9876/stop
$ curl http://roomba:9876/forward #e.g., the roomba drives forward until it receives a 'stop'
$ curl http://roomba:9876/back
$ curl http://roomba:9876/cw
$ curl http://roomba:9876/ccw
```

So the following shell command would rotate the roomba clockwise for 10 seconds:
```bash
$ curl http://roomba:9876/cw && sleep 10 && curl http://roomba:9876/stop
```

# Development notes

The webserver and the frontend interface (for your browser) are both written in Haskell, implying that some Haskell source code has been transcompiled into executable Javascript for the browser. Thanks to the Haskell community's efforts, this process is quite simple (approximately two shell commands). Details below! 

## Prerequisites
These are quickstart instructions to build both the server and the frontend. (If you only want to build the server, then you only need to install `stack`.) These two tools, `stack` and `nvm`, are "fully sandboxed" - they only scribble inside their respective directories in your `$HOME` directory, and won't touch anything else on your system. To elaborate, they sandbox entire language ecosystems - `stack` sandboxes the Haskell language, its dependencies, and your compiled code, and `nvm` similarly sandboxes the NodeJS language, runtime, etc.
* [Install stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/release/doc/install_and_upgrade.md) - the "manual instructions," which just involves adding the `stack` binary to your `$PATH`, are simplest (here's the manual instructions [for OSX](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/release/doc/install_and_upgrade.md#mac-os-x) and [for linux](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/release/doc/install_and_upgrade.md#linux)) but installing it via a package manager (e.g., `apt` or `brew`) is fine if you prefer that. You'll need to download or install at least version 0.1.6.0 to build the frontend. After downloading `stack`, run the following to fetch some dependencies into stack's sandbox:
```bash
$ stack setup # should download some stuff to ~/.stack/ and successfully complete
```
* Install Node. There are several ways to do it, but [here's the best](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#manual-install):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm && cd ~/.nvm && git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`
$ echo '. $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile # (if you use a bash terminal)
$ source ~/.bash_profile # again, assuming you use a bash terminal
$ nvm --version # should work
```

Uninstallation is trivial: just delete `~/.nvm` and `~/.stack` and the `stack` binary itself. `stack` will also put the results of the code you build in `~/.local/bin` - if you don't already have a `~/.local` directory in your `$HOME` folder, you can delete that too.

## Build the server
```bash
$ cd botapi/server
$ stack build --ghc-options="-O2 -static -optl-static -optl-pthread" --copy-bins
```

## Prerequisites for the frontend:
This step takes a while, but you'll only have to run it once. It will compile a Javascript transcompiler for the frontend. These details aren't important to just use this project for your lab, but under the hood, `stack` will build a tool called [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs), which compiles a frontend written in Haskell to Javascript, so that `botserver` can serve the Javascript to your browser, and you can drive your robot around without installing an application on your phone or laptop (and in a future version of `stack`, hopefully building GHCJS won't be necessary, and this section will be omitted). Once GHCJS is built, the last step tries the compiler out by building the frontend. 

Before building GHCJS, we need to tell GHCJS where to find a binary called `happy`:
```bash
$ cd botapi/server && stack install happy && export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH && cd ..
```
`happy` is required to build GHCJS's dependencies, but `happy` must be built with GHC (the regular, non-Javascript Haskell compiler) and not GHCJS, so the above command uses the version of GHC available to `botserver` to compile `happy`, and temporarily adds the binary (which `stack` placed in your `~/.local/bin/` directory) to our path, for GHCJS to use. Now we can build GHCJS:
```bash
$ cd botapi/frontend
$ nvm install v0.12.7
$ nvm use v0.12.7 # nvm will set up your terminal session's $PATH to point to its sandboxed version of node
$ node --version #should tell you you're using 0.12.17
$ stack setup # this will take a long while
$ stack build # this will take a little while more, but it's exciting! Haskell-to-Javascript compilation!
```
`stack build` will by default output everything in a directory deep within the bowels of your project. If you're curious you can look at the directory contents with `$ ls $(stack path --local-install-root)/bin/roombajs.jsexe/` but we can use GHCJS directly instead (it's simpler!) to compile changes now. 

# Editing and running the server

Now that your development environment is complete, it's quite simple to make changes to the code. Any changes to the `botserver` can be recompiled with:

```bash
$ stack build --ghc-options="-O2 -static -optl-static -optl-pthread" --copy-bins
```

which places a binary called `botserver` in `~/.local/bin/` - Running this binary (`./botserver`) on your laptop starts the server, but where's the javascript? Let's first compile the frontend so that it uses nicer CSS `index.html` and includes a picture of the roomba (shamelessly taken from the roomba's instruction manual):

```bash
$ cd botapi/frontend
$ nvm use v0.12.7 # only necessary if your last nvm temrinal session is no longer active (check by running "nvm current")
$ stack exec ghcjs -- --make app.hs 
```

This produces a folder called `app.jsexe` with a bunch of compiled javascript in it. As long as that directory is in the same directory as `botserver`, then running `botserver` will serve the javascript up too. Easy!

```bash
$ cd botapi/frontend
$ cp ~/.local/bin/botserver .
$ ls 
> botserver
> app.jsexe/
> ...
$ ./botserver #now navigate to http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:9876 in your browser
```
